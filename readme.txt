== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* [SportsPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sportspress/) 1.9 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of SportsPress for Cricket, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "SportsPress for Cricket" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our cricket plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you're sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our cricket plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event/team/player/staff pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Edit Match screen featuring Extras and Did Not Bat option.
2. Bowlers are swapped between the innings and players who did not bat are displayed in a separate section.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will SportsPress for Cricket work with my theme? =
